TODO

- Roundstart/spawned? borgs start with disk
- HUD display for disk presence/capacity (or just whether data is being saved?)
- Insert/remove disk while in robotics dock
- Eject disk from robotics dock
- File to text formatter?

- In cyborg module rewriter:

  - Spend points, add tool to module, tool is flagged as custom addition, only X custom additions per module
  - Spending points a) deletes file, b) adds file to list of file IDs that have been processed
  - Can only insert a single disk at a time, select file to spend, extra points wasted
  - Reset blows away custom additions, change UI to confirm choice

- Supersize module that requires larger chest but has more custom addition slots

- Upgrade that increases generation rate
